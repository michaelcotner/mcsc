# mcsc

A collection of functions that I've made over time for single cell analysis. Mostly things that I made that I have used or likely will use more than once. Use alongside `scanpy`. This is mostly for my own use and reference, but you're welcome to be here.

## use

Navigate to any directory accessible by your python analysis file and run:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/name/etc/main/etc.py
```

In your analysis python script, import the file with:

```py
from import
```
