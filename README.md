# mcsc

A collection of functions that I've made over time for single cell analysis. Mostly things that I made that I have used or likely will use more than once. Use alongside `scanpy`. This is mostly for my own use and reference, but you're welcome to be here.

## use

Navigate to any directory accessible by your python script and run:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelcotner/mcsc/main/mcsc.py
```

In your python script, import the file with:

```py
from path_to_file import mcsc
```

### updating

If I've added new functions to `mcsc` that you want to use, you can update the file with:

```
wget -N -O mcsc.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelcotner/mcsc/main/mcsc.py
```

`mcsc` will warn you if there is a new version available.
